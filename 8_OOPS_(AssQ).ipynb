        "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of combining data and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It enables data hiding and abstraction, where the internal details of the class are hidden from the outside world, and only the necessary information and functionality are exposed. Encapsulation helps in organizing code, enhancing security, and promoting modularity.\n",
        "2. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class, and the class from which it inherits is called the superclass or base class. Inheritance promotes code reusability and hierarchical organization of classes, where subclasses can inherit and extend the attributes and methods of the superclass. It allows for the creation of specialized classes based on more general ones.\n",
        "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means having multiple forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface or method to represent objects of different classes. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, while method overloading enables the existence of multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a class.\n",
        "4. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units. It focuses on defining the essential features and behaviors of objects while hiding the unnecessary details. Abstraction allows us to create abstract classes and interfaces that provide a blueprint for subclasses to follow. It helps in managing complexity, enhancing modularity, and promoting code reusability."
